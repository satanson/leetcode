1. unordered_set<pair<int,int>> needs hash function,so use set<pair<int,int>>
2. BFS traverse,mark visited vertex. 
two time point to mark vertex:
(a).mark vertex before pushed the vertex into queue.
(b).mark vertex after the vertex poped from queue.
when use (b),more duplicated vertex will pushed into queue,so use a set to determine if the vertex is in queue or not.
